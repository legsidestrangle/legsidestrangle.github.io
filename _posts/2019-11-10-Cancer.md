In this problem we will be trying to automate the classification of evidence based on each genetic variations.
Once sequenced, a cancer tumor can have thousands of genetic mutations. But the challenge is distinguishing the mutations that contribute to tumor growth (drivers) from the neutral mutations (passengers). So in general the following steps are followed 
 1) A molecular pathologist selects a list of genetic variations of interest that he/she want to analyze
 2) The molecular pathologist searches for evidence in the medical literature that somehow are relevant to the genetic variations of interest
 3) Finally this molecular pathologist spends a huge amount of time analyzing the evidence related to each of the variations to classify them
 
We collect the data from kaggle and the problem is  Multi class classification problem as there are 9 different classes labels  for us to classify. 

The data we will be dealing with are of two types one conatins the information about the genetic mutations and the other contains the clinical evidence (text) that  human experts/pathologists use to classify the genetic mutations.

The above two data sets are merged after removing those data points where text description is not available. We have to remove them as they don't give us any information.
