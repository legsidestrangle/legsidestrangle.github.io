Getting a taxi in a city is always 

Yellow Taxi are famous NYC yellow taxis that provide transportation exclusively through street-hails. The number of taxicabs is limited by a finite number of medallions issued by the TLC. You access this mode of transportation by standing in the street and hailing an available taxi with your hand. The pickups are not pre-arranged.

# Data exploration and cleaning : 

We get the data from : http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml (2015-2016 data) The data used in the attached datasets were collected and provided to the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) 

For this project we will be using only 2015 data.

Next we will be doing univariate analysis and removing outlier/illegitimate values which may be caused due to some error

Lets define the lattitude and logitude of NYC and remove any outliers first we check for pick up 

It is inferred from the source https://www.flickr.com/places/info/2459115 that New York is bounded by the location cordinates(lat,long) - (40.5774, -74.15) & (40.9176,-73.7004) so hence any cordinates not within these cordinates are not considered by us as we are only concerned with pickups which originate within New York.

As we see there are some points which are not in NYC and we have to remove that since we are only concerned with NYC. 

Now we do the same for drop off locations so we will be using the similar code and we find similar observations we found for pick up locations.
