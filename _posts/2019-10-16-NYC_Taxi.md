Getting a taxi in a city is always 

Yellow Taxi are famous NYC yellow taxis that provide transportation exclusively through street-hails. The number of taxicabs is limited by a finite number of medallions issued by the TLC. You access this mode of transportation by standing in the street and hailing an available taxi with your hand. The pickups are not pre-arranged.

# Data exploration and cleaning : 

We get the data from : http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml (2015-2016 data) The data used in the attached datasets were collected and provided to the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) 

For this project we will be using only 2015 data.
