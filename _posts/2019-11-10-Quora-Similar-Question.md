Quora is a social media platform where knowledge sharing happens via questions and answers. Nearly 100 million people visit the website every month so there are lot of questions and answers being shared on that website, which brings in a unique problem of duplicate questions, i.e same questions being asked by different people. It's very important for Quora to eliminate the duplicate questions and provide a better experience for people who are seeking answers and those who are putting in effort to write them. In this we will find out how this was solved. First we define the problem statement. 

# Problem Statement and Constraints: 
The basic task is to identify which quesions asked on Quora are duplicates of questions already asked. We will have to predict whether a pair of questions are questions are duplicate or not. We have to realise that the cost of misclassification is very high and that's we need to be set thresholds for the probability of pair of questions being duplicate. 

Before we jump into understanding the data, we need to understand what kind of machine learning problem we will be working on. Knowing this will give us a clear goal to work on. Since we will only be prediction if a question is duplicate or not,our output variable will be (Y) either 0's or 1's. Because of this it becomes a simple binary classification problem. 
But our final aim is not to  just have 0's and 1's but to have a probability value with which we can tell if the questions are duplicate or not. So for that we will be using log loss method as the performance metric for our classification problem. We also have another performance metric called Binary Confsion matrix which I will be explaining later but thisi is another metric which will give us more insights into our solution. 

# Exploratory Data Analysis

 We will be performing some basic statistics to gain some knowledge about the data set which will help us in solving the problem. In this we try to find out number of question pairs

# Code and Syntax Highlighting
Use back-ticks for `inline code`. Multi-line code snippets are supported too through Pygments.

{% highlight js %}
// Sample javascript code
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight python %}
# Sample python code
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
{% endhighlight %}

Adding `linenos` to the Pygments tag enables line numbers.

{% highlight js  linenos %}
// Sample javascript code
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
{% endhighlight %}

# Blockquotes
{% highlight markdown %}
> Curabitur blandit tempus porttitor. Nullam quis risus eget urna mollis ornare vel eu leo. Nullam id dolor id nibh ultricies vehicula ut id elit.

{% endhighlight %}

> Curabitur blandit tempus porttitor. Nullam quis risus eget urna mollis ornare vel eu leo. Nullam id dolor id nibh ultricies vehicula ut id elit.
