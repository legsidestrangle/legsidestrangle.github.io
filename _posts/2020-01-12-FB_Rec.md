Social media networks are built on connections, by definition  they are supposed to facilitate sharing of information, ideas and various forms of expression from personal to professional. We don’t just connect with people we know but it lets us connect with people we may not know based on shared interests. How does a social media network like facebook lets you find new people and people who are related to your ‘friends’ on it’s website? It uses a concept called graph theory to represent users and it’s connections and by using various algorithms builts a recommeding system which lets you find out new people. 
We will be discussing how math is used and what all algoritms are optimal for such recommending system. 

In this case we will using data set provided to us by facebook via a kaggle. (provide link here). 
We will be disuccsing the format and limitations of this particular data set in further sections but before that, I would like to introduce basic terminology of graph theory. 
users in facebook or any social media are represented by something called nodes, these nodes are profiles or pages of indicidual users. these nodes are ‘connected’ via a link or edge to other users(nodes). The problem we have in this particular project is to predict if a particular new user can be connected to already existing user or users.
